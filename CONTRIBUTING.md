# Contributing to DATTES

If you'd like to contribute to DATTES (thanks!), please have a look at the [guidelines below](#workflow).

If you're already familiar with our workflow, maybe have a quick look at the [pre-commit checks](#pre-commit-checks) directly below.

## Pre-commit checks

Before you commit any code, please perform the following checks:

- [No code issues](#coding-style-guidelines): `checkcode('your_new_code_functions.m')`
- [All tests pass](#testing): run all scripts in [tests folder](tests)


## Workflow

We use [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [GitLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab) to coordinate our work. When making any kind of update, we try to follow the procedure below.

### A. Before you begin

1. Create an [issue](https://gitlab.com/dattes/dattes/-/issues) where new proposals can be discussed before any coding is done.
2. Create a [branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/) of this repo (ideally on your own [fork](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html)), where all changes will be made
3. Download the source code onto your local system, by [cloning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/) the repository (or your fork of the repository).
4. [Install](https://dattes.gitlab.io/page/documentation/getting_started/) DATTES.
5. [Test](#testing) if your installation worked, using the test function: ` `.

You now have everything you need to start making changes!

### B. Writing your code

6. DATTES is developed in [Matlab ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB)). All its features are also available with [GNU Octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave)
7. Make sure to follow our [coding style guidelines](#coding-style-guidelines).
8. Commit your changes to your branch with [useful, descriptive commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/): Remember these are publicly visible and should still make sense a few months ahead in time. While developing, you can keep using the Gitlab issue you're working on as a place for discussion. [Refer to your commits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8910271/how-can-i-reference-a-commit-in-an-issue-comment-on-github) when discussing specific lines of code.
9. If you want to add a dependency on another library, or re-use code you found somewhere else, have a look at [these guidelines](#dependencies-and-reusing-code).

### C. Merging your changes with DATTES

10. [Test your code!](#testing)
11. DATTES has online documentation at https://dattes.gitlab.io/. To make sure any new methods or classes you added show up there, please read the [documentation](#documentation) section.
12. If you added a major new feature, perhaps it should be showcased in an [example notebook](#example-notebooks).
13. When you feel your code is finished, or at least warrants serious discussion, run the [pre-commit checks](#pre-commit-checks) and then [push your improvement](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/push_options.html)  on [DATTE's Gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/dattes/dattes).


### D. General acceptance criteria
Once a push request has been created, it will be reviewed by any member of the community. Changes might be suggested which you can make by simply adding new commits to the branch. When everything's finished, someone with the right Gitlab permissions will merge your changes into DATTES main repository.
Nevertheless, you merge request should respect some critera (exceptions can be made):
1. **not very big**: Your contributions should not exceed in general 5 changed files
2. **one thing a time**: All changes in one merge request must be related (one new feature or fix at a time).
3. **do not create any regression**: New features must not make the code to regress or limit other features 


## Coding guidelines

DATTES follows the [Matlab coding recommendations](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22943-guidelines-for-writing-clean-and-fast-code-in-matlab) for coding style. These are very common guidelines, and community tools have been developed to check how well projects implement them.
Beside these recommendations, some other should be respected:
## Naming
In DATTES, naming is aimed to be as descriptive and short as possible. 
[Snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) is used to name the variables, arrays, structures and functions. Using abbreviations is avoided when possible without making names overly long.

Please avoid using single letter variable names.
A typical example is using **i** or **j** as for loop counter.
This will overwrite the complex number!

## Dependencies and reusing code

While it's a bad idea for developers to "reinvent the wheel", it's important for users to get a _reasonably sized download and a free and easy install_. External libraries can sometimes be not free or cease to be supported. For these reasons, all dependencies in DATTES should be thought about carefully, and discussed on Gitlab.

## Testing

All code requires testing. These tests typically just check that the code runs without error, and so, are more _debugging_ than _testing_ in a strict sense. Nevertheless, they are very useful to have!


### Writing tests

Every new feature should have its own test. To create ones, have a look at the `tests` directory and see if there's a test for a similar method. Copy-pasting this is a good way to start.

Next, add some simple (and speedy!) tests of your main features. If these run without exceptions that's a good start! Next, check the output of your methods using any of these [assert methods](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/assert.html).



### Debugging

Often, the code you write won't pass the tests straight away, at which stage it will become necessary to debug.
The key to successful debugging is to isolate the problem by finding the smallest possible example that causes the bug.
In practice, there are a few tricks to help you to do this, which are described [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/debugging-process-and-features.html).

Once you've isolated the issue, it's a good idea to add a unit test that replicates this issue, so that you can easily check whether it's been fixed, and make sure that it's easily picked up if it crops up again.
This also means that, if you can't fix the bug yourself, it will be much easier to ask for help (by opening a [bug-report issue](https://gitlab.com/dattes/dattes/-/issues/new)).




### Profiling

Sometimes, a bit of code will take much longer than you expect to run. In this case, you can follow [these instructions][https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/profiling-for-improving-performance.html) to fix this.


## Documentation

DATTES is documented in several ways.

First and foremost, every method and every class should have a [help](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-help-for-your-program.html) that describes in plain terms what it does, and what the expected input and output is.

 For example, here is the dattes.m help :
